# Advances in Robotics 2019: Dynamic modulation of human interactive robots using Impedance Control

## Abstract
Human-robot interaction is prominently seen in industries, haptics etc. where the underlying objective is to make the robot assistive in nature to the human. A methodology is proposed herein to improve
the assistive nature of the robot by reducing the inertia felt by the human. An impedance controller is presented to modulate the dynamics of the manipulator and assign an apparent inertia to the
robot. Simulation results with the case study of a five-bar manipulator demonstrate that the required human force is lesser after the implementation of the impedance controller. Furthermore,
the kinematics of the five-bar are formulated analytically using a novel computationally less intensive approach. It is also shown that the computation of the proposed kinematics does not suffer at the
singularity configurations.
